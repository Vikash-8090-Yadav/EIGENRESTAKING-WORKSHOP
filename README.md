## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- An Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with its public address noted.
- The Holesky or Sepolia network added to your wallet.  
  If it doesn't appear automatically, configure it manually.

## Step 1: Obtain Testnet ETH

To participate, you'll need testnet ETH. Use a faucet to load your wallet with Holesky or Sepolia ETH.

**Options for Obtaining Sepolia ETH (sepETH):**
- [Sepolia PoW Faucet](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/)
- [Google Cloud Faucet for Holesky](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky)

**Instructions:**
1. Visit one of the faucets listed above.
2. Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Sepolia or Holesky network.
3. Follow the faucet's instructions to receive testnet ETH.

## Step 2: Acquire Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)

Stake your testnet ETH to obtain LSTs such as **stETH** or **rETH**.

- Use platforms like **Lido** or **Rocket Pool** to stake your ETH.
- Follow the platform's instructions to receive stETH or rETH in your wallet.

---

## Step 3: Swap holETH for wETH

Swap your Holesky ETH (holETH) for Wrapped ETH (wETH).

- Use a compatible decentralized exchange or platform to swap holETH for wETH.
- Send the wETH to the address:  
  `0x94373a4919B3240D86eA41593D5eBa789FEF3848`
- Import the wETH token address (`0x94373a4919B3240D86eA41593D5eBa789FEF3848`) into your wallet to view your token balance.

## Step 4: Deposit LSTs into EigenLayer

Deposit your LSTs into EigenLayer on the Holesky testnet.

1. Visit [Holesky EigenLayer](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/).
2. Connect your wallet to the Holesky network.
3. Select your LST (e.g., stETH or rETH) and deposit it into the EigenLayer contract.
4. Choose a validator operator to delegate your LSTs for AVS security.
5. Sign the transactions to confirm the deposit.
6. Monitor your rewards via the EigenLayer interface.
