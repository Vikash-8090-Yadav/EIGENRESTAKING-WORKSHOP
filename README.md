EigenLayer Testnet Workshop: Obtaining and Staking Testnet ETH
This workshop guides you through the process of obtaining testnet ETH, acquiring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), depositing them into EigenLayer on the Holesky testnet, and swapping holETH for wETH.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

An Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with its public address noted.
The Holesky or Sepolia network added to your wallet. If it doesn't appear automatically, configure it manually. Guide: https://support.metamask.io/more-web3/learn/eth-on-testnets/.

Step 1: Obtain Testnet ETH
To participate, you'll need testnet ETH. Use a faucet to load your wallet with Holesky or Sepolia ETH.
Options for Obtaining Sepolia ETH (sepETH):

Sepolia PoW Faucet: https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/

Google Cloud Faucet: https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky


Visit one of the faucets listed above.
Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Sepolia or Holesky network.
Follow the faucet's instructions to receive testnet ETH.

Step 2: Acquire Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)
Stake your testnet ETH to obtain LSTs such as stETH or rETH.

Use platforms like Lido or Rocket Pool to stake your ETH.
Follow the platform's instructions to receive stETH or rETH in your wallet.

Step 3: Swap holETH for wETH
Swap your Holesky ETH (holETH) for Wrapped ETH (wETH).

Use a compatible decentralized exchange or platform to swap holETH for wETH.
Send the wETH to the address: 0x94373a4919B3240D86eA41593D5eBa789FEF3848.
Import the wETH token address (0x94373a4919B3240D86eA41593D5eBa789FEF3848) into your wallet to view your token balance.


Step 3: Deposit LSTs into EigenLayer
Deposit your LSTs into EigenLayer on the Holesky testnet.

Visit Holesky EigenLayer:  https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/.

Connect your wallet to the Holesky network.

Select your LST (e.g., stETH or rETH) and deposit it into the EigenLayer contract.
Choose a validator operator to delegate your LSTs for AVS security.
Sign the transactions to confirm the deposit.
Monitor your rewards via the EigenLayer interface.
